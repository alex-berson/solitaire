## Description

**Solitaire**, also known as **Peg Solitaire**, is a single-player game played on a board with holes arranged in a cross pattern. At the start, pegs occupy all the holes except the center one.

The game involves jumping one peg over another into an empty hole, with jumps allowed only horizontally or vertically. The peg that is jumped over is removed from the board.

The objective is to clear the board of all pegs except one, ideally leaving it in the center hole, which is the inverse of the starting setup.
